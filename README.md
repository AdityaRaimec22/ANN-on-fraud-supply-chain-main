# Artificial Neural Networks for Fraud Detection in Supply Chain Analytics: A Study on MLPClassifier and Keras

In this study, we aimed to detect fraudulent activities in the supply chain through the use of neural networks. The study focused on building two machine learning models using the MLPClassifier algorithm from the scikit-learn library and a custom neural network using the Keras library in Python. Both models were trained and tested on the DataCo Supply Chain dataset. The results showed that the custom neural network achieved an accuracy of 97.67% in detecting fraudulent transactions, demonstrating its potential to minimize financial losses for organizations.
